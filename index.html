        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            During my studies at Rhodes University, I completed my MBA degree and gained valuable knowledge and skills
            from a
            business and management perspective. I majored in Information Systems and Economics for my undergraduate
            degree and
            the following year completed an entrepreneur diploma (Postgraduate Diploma in Enterprise Management) with a
            distinction. However recently, I changed career paths at the beginning of January 2021 and focused on coding
            again.
            I am passionate about developing programs that assist companies with their day-to-day operations and
            providing
            solutions for complex situations. Designing these types of programs has ignited a passion to make the career
            change
            and to help clients/users reach their goals.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am currently acting as a consultant for a logistics company and have developed a program on MS
            Access(VBA/SQL)
            that assists their operations team with automating their admin tasks and to eliminate human errors. I am
            also
            involved in developing a few Website projects for local companies. These projects include: a Wedding
            website,
            Cricket Coaching Video Website and an African Safari Tourism Blog. In addition, I have been developing a
            Cricket
            Simulator game, of my own design, using VBA/SQL.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have always enjoyed working with numbers and formulas, including the use of MS Excel and MS Access, thus I
            have
            gained experience in writing up VBA code and SQL queries to analyse big data. Working on a contract basis
            for the
            logisticsâ€™ company (PortFreight Pty Ltd) has given me the confidence to create an automated system for their
            operations. As a result, the program has helped them reduce their costs, through eliminating human error,
            and
            reduced their workload. This was done by implementing complex formulas on their Excel and Access documents
            which
            collates accurate information from different worksheets, forms, and from their main database. The creation
            of a
            cricket simulator game on MS Excel, has enabled me to achieve one of my goals of producing a simple game by
            using
            VBA. Using MS Access, I created several SQL queries and forms that produce up to statistics on the different
            teams
            and players in the game. Although this is a simple game it can be adapted to be a simulator for real data
            showing
            that it can be applicable in real world applications.
        </p>
        <p>
            I enjoy being challenged and interacting with projects that require me to think outside the box. In the past
            year
            alone, I have learnt and engaged with the fundamentals of Web Development, React Native, C#, C++ and
            Flutter/Dart. I
            am always striving to learn more skills and increase my knowledge of different and upcoming coding
            practices. I
            thoroughly enjoy working in a team and am also comfortable to work independently on projects. I strongly
            believe my
            previous work experience; my passion and dedication make me the ideal candidate. I would be happy
            to start in any position, from a junior level or an internship, and work my way up in the company.

                        On Microsoft Excel, I created a program that was original just populated with formulas to help the Logistics
                        company
                        eliminate human error and to automate the system as much as possible to make the Operations team's tasksmore
                        efficient. The owners of the company asked me to convert the excel programto a Microsoft Access. I designed
                        a
                        Datasheet Form for the Operations team that is filled with drop-down boxes and text boxes that allow the
                        user to
                        insert relevant information. Using VBA Code, there are buttons created that allows the user to automatically
                        retrieve Stock Information from CSV/Excel files. There are also SQL Queries that help retrieve Stock
                        information
                        based on the user's selection andinput in the Datasheet Form

                        The game will consist of a couple of buttons which randomly generate numbers between 0-6 (runs scored) through VBA
                        coding. If the number generated is 5 it will automatically generate another random number between 1-10 (BowlersRoll)
                        through VBA coding. The numbers generated will be stored on the scoredcard (spreadsheet) and there are formulas
                        created to determine the batmen's score and number of balls faced, as well the bowlers figures and other stats that
                        happen during a normal cricket game. The user will be able to choose a bowler after every over and the game will
                        consist of maximum of 20 overs per innings and users will be able to play with teams from the very first One Day
                        International gameplayed in 1971, right through to the current teams and players in the modern era. Using Microsoft
                        Access as a type of server, SQL queries and VBA coding have been created to determine players and teams stats, such
                        as batting averages and strike rates, bowlers average and economies, team stats and many more.
